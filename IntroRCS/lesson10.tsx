          1.11 The Biggest Secret That All Reading Comprehension Masters Know

      <article className="space-y-6 text-gray-300">
        <p>
          The most reliable advantage great readers bring to any passage is simple:
          they choose to be genuinely curious and actively involved in what they’re reading—
          no matter the topic. Engagement isn’t optional; it’s the engine of comprehension.
        </p>

        <MustKnow>
          People who consistently excel on Reading Comprehension make themselves
          interested in every passage and stay mentally involved from start to finish.
        </MustKnow>

        <p>
          One of the most damaging habits on RC is approaching a passage with a
          “just get it over with” mindset. Skimming to finish erodes attention and prevents
          the kind of processing needed to understand structure, purpose, and detail.
        </p>

        <MustKnow>
          A common pitfall is reading to be done, not reading to understand. That approach
          undermines accuracy and retention.
        </MustKnow>

        <p>
          Interest and comprehension move together. When you care—even a little—your brain
          naturally asks questions, monitors logic, and notices transitions. When you
          don’t, attention drifts and understanding drops sharply.
        </p>

        <MustKnow>
          Disinterest leads to weaker comprehension because your attention system
          disengages and stops monitoring meaning.
        </MustKnow>

        <p>
          The fix is practical and within your control: decide to be curious about the
          passage in front of you. If genuine curiosity doesn’t come easily at first,
          act as if you’re fascinated—your focus will follow.
        </p>

        <MustKnow>
          Choose engagement. Even if you have to “fake it” at the start, do what it takes
          to be interested and attentive as you read.
        </MustKnow>

        <p>
          Without interest, you won’t probe unclear statements, connect ideas,
          or patch holes in understanding. That’s why curiosity is a performance skill,
          not a personality trait.
        </p>

        <MustKnow>
          If you aren’t interested, you’re less likely to question the text or resolve
          gaps in understanding—and your accuracy will suffer.
        </MustKnow>

        <p>
          Engagement and comprehension form a positive loop: the more engaged you are,
          the more you understand; the more you understand, the easier it is to stay engaged.
          Build that loop on purpose.
        </p>

        <MustKnow>
          Interest and understanding reinforce each other. Curiosity boosts comprehension,
          and comprehension makes curiosity easier to sustain.
        </MustKnow>

        <p>
          Don’t limit this to GMAT passages. Train yourself to lean into unfamiliar topics
          in everything you read—articles, reports, essays. By test day, engaging with a
          new passage will feel natural.
        </p>

        <p>
          We’ve repeatedly seen that students who treat RC passages as chances to learn
          something new outperform those who read only to complete the task. Adopt that mindset.
        </p>

        <MustKnow>
          Treat every passage as an opportunity to learn. Students who do so typically
          score higher than those who read merely to finish.
        </MustKnow>

            How to build interest on the spot
          </h3>
          <ul className="ml-5 list-disc space-y-2">
            <li>Before reading, ask: “What is the author trying to accomplish here?”</li>
            <li>As you read, note the purpose of each paragraph in a few words.</li>
            <li>When something feels dense, convert it into your own simple sentence.</li>
            <li>If a detail seems random, ask: “Why did the author include this now?”</li>
            <li>Look for tension: competing views, cause/effect, problem/solution.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <p>
          Bottom line: interest is a skill you can switch on. Turn it on for every passage,
          and your comprehension—and your score—will rise.
