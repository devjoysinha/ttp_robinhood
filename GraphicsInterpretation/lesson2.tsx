              For the first blank, focus only on the East series (gray). We want months where the East
              revenue is below 5 million. In inequality form, count months m with{" "}

              For the second blank, compare East vs. West month by month. We&rsquo;re counting months where
              the gray point is higher than the black point:{" "}
              <InlineMath math={"r_E(m) > r_W(m)"} />. There are also six months meeting this condition.

        <p>
          When a question includes a graph or chart, resist the urge to dive straight into the prompts.
          First, take a step back and understand the big picture: what does the visual—and its caption
          or notes—actually convey?
        </p>

        <MustKnow>
          A powerful first step is to write a single sentence that captures the essence of the graphic.
          This one‑liner acts like your compass, helping you stay oriented as you tackle the specific questions.
        </MustKnow>

        <p>
          This idea mirrors the “simple story” strategy from Reading Comprehension:
          summarize first, then retrieve details only if you really need them.
        </p>

        <MustKnow>
          Before reading any sub‑questions, synthesize the text and the visual to form a clear,
          high‑level picture. Avoid getting bogged down in granular labels or small ticks unless a
          question forces you there.
        </MustKnow>

        <p>Consider this column chart:</p>

        <Figure
          src="https://ttpgmat-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/ckeditor/pictures/764/content_1889_average_temperatures.png"
          alt="Clustered column chart with monthly average temperatures for California, Texas, and New York"
          width={900}
          height={605}
          caption="Monthly average temperatures for three U.S. states across the year."
        />

        <p>
          A concise summary could be: “This chart shows each state’s average temperature for every month.”
          That’s enough to orient yourself. Only fetch specifics when the question requires them.
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li className="my-1">
            If asked for Texas in June, find the Texas bar over June and read roughly 92.
          </li>
          <li className="my-1">
            If asked for California in February, read about 60.
          </li>
          <li className="my-1">
            If asked for New York’s highest average, scan the New York bars and pick the tallest: about 85 (July).
          </li>
        </ul>

            Key takeaway
          </h3>
          <p>
            Lead with structure, not detail. Summarize what the graphic shows in one sentence, then
            locate only the pieces you need. Mathematically, this often boils down to checking simple
            relationships like <InlineMath math={"x < c"} /> or comparing series values like{" "}
            <InlineMath math={"r_E(m) > r_W(m)"} /> at specific points.
          </p>

Notes and implementation details:
- Accessibility: All interactive controls include labels, helpful descriptions, keyboard focus states, and aria-live status updates for results. The “Show explanation” section uses a native details/summary pattern.
- Responsiveness: Layout is fully responsive. Images scale fluidly and are constrained by a max width.
- Performance:
  - next/image is used for images to get responsive sizing and lazy loading (priority is false by default).
  - No heavy client JS except for the small interactive example, which is dynamically loaded client-side.
- KaTeX: Inline inequalities and comparisons are rendered via react-katex. The page imports the KaTeX CSS.
- Content: All instructional copy is paraphrased to preserve intent while avoiding verbatim text.
